# HAPPI - Adaptive
Welcome to the repository for the updated version of the Happi model. The Happi model is an agent-based model specifically designed to explore the low-carbon transition of the power system, developed using Python.


**About the Model**

The Happi model serves as a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of power systems during their transition to low-carbon alternatives. It employs advanced agent-based modeling techniques to simulate investors' investment decisions, as well as various uncertian scenarios and outcomes.

[More details about the model and its features will be coming soon to GitHub.]
